- Write a function that can take in any number of arguments, and returns the sum of all of the arguments.

- Write a function called `addOnlyNums` that can take in any number of arguments (including numbers or strings), and returns the sum of only the numbers.

```js
addOnlyNums(1, 'cat', 3, 4); //8
```

- Write a function called `countTheArgs` that can take any number of arguments, and returns the number of arguments that are passed in.

```js
countTheArgs('cat', 'dog'); //2
countTheArgs('cat', 'dog', 'frog', 'bear'); //4
```

- Write a function called `combineTwoArrays` that takes in two arrays as arguments, and returns a single array that combines both (using the spread operator).

- Write a function called `sumEveryOther` that takes in any amount of arguments, and returns the sum of every other argument.

```js
sumEveryOther(5, 6, 3, 4, 1); //9
sumEveryOther(10, 2, 11); //21
```

- Write a function called `onlyUniques` that can take in any number of arguments, and returns an array of only the unique arguments.

```js
onlyUniques('cat', 'cat', 'dog', 'pig'); //['cat', 'dog', 'pig']
onlyUniques(1, 4, 7, 1, 2, 7, 4); //[1, 4, 7, 2]
```

- Write a function called `combineAllArrays` that takes in any number of arrays as arguments and combines all of them into one array.

- Write a function called `squareAndSum` that takes in any number of arguments, squares them, then sums all of the squares.

```js
sumAndSquare(2, 4, 3); //29
sumAndSquare(1, 2); //5
```

- Write a function called `findMin` that accepts a variable number of arguments and returns the smallest argument. Make sure to do this using the rest and spread operator.

- Write a function called `mergeObjects` that accepts two objects and returns a new object which contains all the keys and values of the first object and second object.

- Write a function called `doubleAndReturnArgs` which accepts an array and a variable number of arguments. The function should return a new array with the original array values and all of additional arguments doubled.

- Remove a random element in the items array
  and return a new array without that item.

- Return a new object with all the keys and values
  from obj and a new key/value pair

- Return a new object with a key removed.

- Combine two objects and return a new object.

- Return a new object with a modified key and value.
